OpenSSL bindings for the [Odin programming language](http://odin-lang.org). Currently incomplete, PRs welcome!

## Installing
Make sure to install the development package of OpenSSL. Under Debian, that would be `libssl-dev`. This process is different between operating system distributions.
Then, just clone this library into your shared collection in the Odin installation folder.

## License
BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" license, see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
